# Secure_Fair_Voting-_System
The **Secure Voting System** is a Spring Boot-based web application enabling users to create voting rooms, manage candidates and voters, cast votes, and view results. It uses an H2 in-memory database for development, with a switch to MySQL for production. API testing can be done via Postman, and Swagger is integrated for easy API documentation.
